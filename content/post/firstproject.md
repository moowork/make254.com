## First project on make254.com
This is soo cool. It's finaly comming alone.

This is what we need to have working in a blog post

## Images
Images is of course a must. we need to show some lovely images

## Code examples
No projects are ( usally ) without code. Either its a snipplet of code from github, a gist or manually entered in here.

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os

print "This is a code example"


```

## Video
Video is also a must. I'm guessing vimeo and youtube videos embedded should suffice. :)
